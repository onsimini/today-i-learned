### Smart Commits

I use Jira, now that it is free for a personnal use, and I wanted to link it with GitHub.
For that I use the github app 'Jira', and I just have to use Smarth Commits to affect my Jira's tickets.

(Atlassian 'Use Smart Commits')[https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/use-smart-commits/]

So you just need to add the ticket number, exp.: JRA-34 will add the branch at the ticket.
After that, you can add comment with #comment followed by your comment.
Time with #time 1w 2d 4h 30m 
A trasition with a # followed by the transition as named in your jira project.
